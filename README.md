## Introduction
This project is a **Social Network API** built using **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**, **Node.js**, and **Express.js**. It provides the backend functionality for a social networking application where users can:

- Create and manage their profiles.
- Share their thoughts (posts) with others.
- React to friends' thoughts with reactions (similar to comments or likes).
- Build and manage a friend list by adding or removing friends.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to handle complex relationships between data, such as users, thoughts, reactions, and friends. It also showcases the use of RESTful API design principles and modular code structure for scalability and maintainability. 

This API is tested using **Insomnia** to perform CRUD operations on users, thoughts, reactions, and friendships. It serves as a foundation for building a full-stack social networking application.

## Features
- Users can create an account and manage their profiles.
- Users can share their thoughts (posts) with others.
- Users can react to friends' thoughts with reactions (similar to comments or likes).
- Users can add other users as friends to build a friend list.
- Users can remove friends from their friend list.
- All data is stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose for schema modeling.
- API endpoints are tested using Insomnia for CRUD operations:
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete users.
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete thoughts.
  - Add and remove reactions to thoughts.
  - Add and remove friends from a user's friend list.
- Built with Node.js and Express.js for the backend.
- Modular code structure for scalability and maintainability.
